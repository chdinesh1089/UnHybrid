# UnHybrid (**Made for GameOff2018 challenge**)

### THEME: 
*HYBRID*
### ABOUT:

The game is **Hyper-casual** one where we want you to be UnHybrid to hit high scores.  It is a simple game where we have to control the ball in such a way that it doesn't hit the poles coming by. These poles make your ball go Hybrid taking different shapes which makes the gameplay a bit difficult to play. We believe in gamification so implemented leaderboard panel to our game where you can find everyone with their high scores.

### HOW TO PLAY:

It is really simple just need use left and right key to play.  Try not to hit the poles and you hit them you take up some *Hybrid* shape which make the game a bit difficult.
